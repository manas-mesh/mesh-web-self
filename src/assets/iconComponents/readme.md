Icon components in this directory are generated through script 'generate-chakra-icons'
which reads svg icons from src/assets/icons directory and generates icon components

DO NOT remove files manually.

A husky hook is also there to run this command on pre-commit

todo: script improvements:

- auto generate index.ts
- keep in sync with icons(remove autogenerated files for deleted icons and also sync entries in index.ts)
- replace 'fill' properties in svg with `fill="currentColor"`
